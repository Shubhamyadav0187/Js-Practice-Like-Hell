# ✅ What is JavaScript & How It Works

## 🧠 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to make web pages interactive. It runs in the browser and can also be used on the server (with Node.js).

## 🔹 JS is used to:
1. Create interactive UIs (e.g., modals, sliders)
2. Validate form inputs
3. Fetch data from APIs (AJAX/fetch)
4. Store data in localStorage
5. Control DOM elements


## ⚙️ 2. How JavaScript Runs in the Browser

## 🧩 JS Engine Workflow:
Parsing: Code is parsed to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
Compilation: Modern engines like V8 just-in-time compile the code
Execution: Executes optimized machine code

## 🚀 Popular JS Engines:
Browser	JS Engine
Chrome - V8, Firefox-SpiderMonkey Safari-JavaScriptCore, Edge-Chakra (now uses V8)


## 🧵 3. JS is Single-threaded & Non-blocking

Single-threaded: Runs one task at a time.
Non-blocking: Uses the event loop to handle tasks like fetching data asynchronously.

📌 Event Loop ensures JS handles multiple operations efficiently without blocking the UI.



## ❓ Interview Questions

### 🔸 Q1: What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?
Answer: ECMAScript is the specification standard; JavaScript is the actual implementation used in browsers and includes additional features like DOM APIs.

### 🔸 Q2: How is JavaScript single-threaded but asynchronous?
Answer: JS uses a single main thread to run code but offloads tasks like timers, API calls to the Web APIs. When they finish, they are added to the callback queue and executed via the event loop.

### 🔸 Q3: What is the role of the JavaScript Engine?
Answer: The JS engine parses, compiles (JIT), and executes code. It manages memory and executes JavaScript instructions efficiently.
